[WIP] In-depth stats
**+ I really want stats stats. not just stats. Ideally, I want to present all this information onto a website. I believe that's the end goal for this bot, and a perfect way to form this into a professional presentation.
 With that in mind, I will need stats for:**


- ⁡⁢⁣⁣𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱⁡: Clear explaintions, comments, even a Wiki if needed for Hercules bot for others to understand. Furthermore, even a 'key' would be nice, clear definitions of words, and why I do things (repeated actions, var names etc) in a certain way. define my thinking, as well as clarity onto what things are. I really want to increase readability.
